This is my harbor, for storing any code snippets for the following:

* libraries that I'm using or about to use
* custom component that I'm developing or already under using

All will be written in **Kotlin**, and separated into multiple
Activities by library or component. And because my work, all the
implementations will support down to **Android-18** as possible. 

But instead, all dependencies will try to catch up the latest version,
even the alpha/beta

Welcome to fire an issue if you want to try something.
